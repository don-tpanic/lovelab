# Project Offerings

# Lovelab ([bradlove.org](http://bradlove.org)), a computational cognitive science lab directed by Prof Brad Love.


We are looking for enthusiastic and motivated students who want to collaborate with Prof Brad Love and members of his [lab](http://bradlove.org). We aim to improve performance of neural network models and make them more human-like by using insights from neuroscience. Students with approrpriate skills with a strong interest in training and evaluating convolutional neural networks should contact Prof Love, b.love@ucl.ac.uk.

## Prerequisites

I am getting some emails from enthusiastic students (always great) who unfortunately do not have the backgrounds to complete the projects below. Students are going to need an undergraduate degree in computer science degree or closely related field. Students should be comfortable with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, version control repositories, and proficient in a language that works well with TensorFlow, such as Python or C. These are not concepts that we are going to teach or tasks my lab will do for you, but the starting points for your project work. We are here to do MSc level research with you, not provide undergraduate training in computer science. There simply isn't enough time to master these basic concepts and also do the project work.

## 1. Unsupervised Task Learning 
Much of human learning is thought to be unsupervised. For example, children do not receive labels for all the objects they encounter in their environment. In contrast, many machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, require supervision in the form of labeled images. The goal of this project is to better understand how humans leverage the statistics of the world and thereby reduce their dependency on supervised training. The project will integrate existing approaches with novel algorithms in order to better understand how unsupervised learning yields feature representations that support high-level cognitive behavior, such as visual categorization.

## 2. Relating the brain to artificial neural networks through embedding spaces
Artificial neural networks (ANN) are useful tools both for doing supervised learning and for creating embedding spaces. Furthermore, they have even proved to have predictive power for the visual ventral stream in the human brain. This project seeks to reverse the direction of influence by using neural embedding spaces derived from fMRI data (e.g., BOLD5000) to improve the interpretability of ANN solutions. Thus, the goal is to tune ANN solutions to be more brain-like by leveraging embedding spaces inferred from fMRI data.
