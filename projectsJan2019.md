# Project Offerings

# Lovelab ([bradlove.org](http://bradlove.org)), a computational cognitive science lab directed by Prof Brad Love.


We are looking for enthusiastic and motivated students who want to collaborate with Prof Brad Love and members of his [lab](http://bradlove.org). We aim to improve performance of neural network models and make them more human-like by using insights from neuroscience. Students with approrpriate skills with a strong interest in training and evaluating convolutional neural networks should contact Prof Love, b.love@ucl.ac.uk.

## Prerequisites

I am getting some emails from enthusiastic students (always great) who unfortunately do not have the backgrounds to complete the projects below. Students are going to need an undergraduate degree in computer science degree or closely related field. Students should be comfortable with linear algebra, multivariate calculus, version control repositories, and proficient in a language that works well with TensorFlow, such as Python or C. These are not concepts that we are going to teach or tasks my lab will do for you, but the starting points for your project work. We are here to do MSc level research with you, not provide undergraduate training in computer science. There simply isn't enough time to master these basic concepts and also do the project work.
